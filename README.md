# MiditoArduino
For SUTD Capstone 45 Pico Musical Engineering Installation project.<br/>
- Input: MIDI file, prefably downloaded from a sheet music site such as MuseScore.<br/>
- Output: Flashing LEDs (or solenoids, etc, depending how you wire your circuit) timed to the music.<br/>

Part 1 of this project takes reference from [falcon](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/Falcon/tree/master/falcon).

There are 4 ranges. The first three are common ranges provided by the Grand Illusions Music Boxes.<br/>
The fourth is a custom range of 25 notes created to provide better versatility.
1. 15-notes: C4-C6, non-chromatic 
2. 20-notes: C4-A6, non-chromatic
3. 30-notes: C0-E3, fully chromatic only in the middle
4. 25-notes: C4-C6, fully-chromatic

Add new MIDI files to `midi folder` and update them in `playlist.txt`

There are 2 parts to this project.

**Part 1: Preprocessing** transposes a MIDI file to fit X-note range. Outputs a txt document in `txt folder` that is readable by Arduino in Part 2.<br/>
Enter the following in your command line:<br/>
`python preprocessing.py [song] [range]`
For example, to play Do Re Mi in 25 note range:<br/>
`python preprocessing.py 2 GI25`

**Part 2: Running** reads the corresponding txt file and sends the notes to play to an Arduino via Serial communication. Result is the song being played in real time through e.g. LED flashing lights.<br/>
You will need a connected Arduino for this to work.<br/>
Enter the following in your command line:<br/>
`python main.py`
