# MiditoArduino
For SUTD Capstone 45 Pico Musical Engineering Installation project.
Input: MIDI file, prefably downloaded from a sheet music site such as MuseScore.
Output: Flashing LEDs (or solenoids, etc, depending how you wire your circuit) timed to the music.

Part 1 of this project takes reference from [falcon](https://github.com/Tenchi2xh/Falcon/tree/master/falcon).

There are 4 ranges. The first three are common ranges provided by the Grand Illusions Music Boxes.
THe fourth is a custom range of 25 notes created to provide better versatility.
1. 15-notes: C4-C6, non-chromatic 
2. 20-notes: C4-A6, non-chromatic
3. 30-notes: C0-E3, fully chromatic only in the middle
4. 25-notes: C4-C6, fully-chromatic

Add new MIDI files to `midi folder` and update them in `playlist.txt`

There are 2 parts to this project.

**Part 1: Preprocessing** transposes a MIDI file to fit X-note range. Outputs a txt document in `txt folder` that is readable by Arduino in Part 2.
Enter the following in your command line:
`python preprocessing.py [song] [range]`
For example, to play Do Re Mi in 25 note range:
`python preprocessing.py 2 GI25`

**Part 2: Running** plays the song in real time through an Arduino (e.g. LED flashing lights) via running a Serial communication with Python.
You will need a connected Arduino for this to work.
Enter the following in your command line:
'python main.py'
